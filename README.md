# Underrepresented words in Dagsavisen vs. Aftenposten

This repo extracts frequency lists using NB DH-lab for a sample of Dagsavisen and Aftenposten from the last ten years and finds underrepresentated words in each of them (relative to the other).

1. Extract frequency lists (make_frequency_lists.ipynb)
2. Calulate underrepresented words using simple ratios (underrepresentation.ipynb)

Step 1) takes some time for a new sample, step 2) uses cached data from 1).
